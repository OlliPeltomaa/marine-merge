## Game idea
In this game your goal is to score points by merging two fish of the same kind. You can drop a fish into a container by left clicking the mouse or by tapping on the screen on mobile. You can move the fish that you drop horizontally by pressing the screen/keeping left mouse button pressed, and drop the fish at your desired location by releasing the mouse/taking the finger of the screen. When two fish merge, they combine into a bigger fish. The game ends when the container is full, and the fish in the container touch the fish about to be dropped next.
